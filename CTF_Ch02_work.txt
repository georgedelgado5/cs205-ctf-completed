Ch02_09_Ltrace :

1. Ran executable file using "./Ch02_09_Ltrace"

2. Message:
   In this level, you will be forced to use dynamic analysis to find the
   password. When programs are dynamically linked, it is possible to monitor
   their calls to the libraries they depend upon such as the strcmp() calls
   to the Standard C library. While you can solve this level in many ways try
   using "ltrace".

3. Ran executable file using "ltrace Ch02_09_Ltrace"

4. Prompt for password appeared

5. Entered test password

6. Message:
   ) = 1
   strcmp("311", "ycgU6Vdd") = -70
   puts("Try again."Try again.
   ) = 11
   +++ exited (status 0) +++

7. Password is shown in error message - displays how it checks for password: uses strcmp()

8. Ran again and entered correct password

9. Solved!

Ch02_09_LdPreloadGetUID:

1. Ran executable file using "./Ch02_09_LdPreloadGetUID"

2. Message:
   Malware can hijack many functions through the use of LD_PRELOAD. Security
   checks using the function getuid() are particularly vulnerable.
   In this level, when you guess the password incorrectly, the program will
   give you a hint as to what the password is, if you have a specific
   UID. If you are able to to hijack the getuid() function and get it to
   output a specific UID, you will receive the password. In order to
   solve this level, create a dynamic shared object file that implements
   getuid() and returns the UID. Use LD_PRELOAD to preload your library.
   You will need to employ specific flags within gcc that will produce
   dynamic, position-independent, shared object code.

3. Entered test password:

4. Message:
   If you run this program with the UID of 174963, the password
   the password will be given on the nextline.

   Error: UID 19550 ran us. We expected UID 174963.
   Try again.

5. Create a ".c" file (can have any name)

   - added:
     #include <unistd.h>
     uid_t getuid(void) {
     return 174963;
     }

6. Used "man ld.so" -> used to create a shared .o file

7. Used "gcc -shared -rdynamic -o main.c main.so"
   - -shared enables "ld" indirectly

8. man "ld.so" again to look for "LD_PRELOAD" mentioned in the original message
   - The order of using LD_PRELOAD is important

9. Ran program using "LD_PRELOAD=./main.so ./Ch02_09_LdPreloadGetUID"

10. Entered test password again

11. getuid function provided hint to password

- Hint: gg7GKdNqF

12. Solved!

Ch02_09_Readelf:

1. Ran executable file using "./Ch02_09_Readelf"

2. Message:
   In this level, you will experiment with basic static analysis of binaries.
   Your goal is to find the password that unlocks the program so it prints
   "Good Job". While you can solve this level many ways, try using the
   "readelf -a <binary>" to find the section number where the password might
   be stored, then use "readelf -x <section_number> <binary>" to list the
   contents of the section which likely has the password in it. You may also
   use the command "objdump -j" on the appropriate section of the binary
   or "objdump -s" to solve it.

3. Used "man objdump"
   - Other option is to use "hexdump -C ./Ch02_09_Readelf"
     - This was disucssed in class (I missed that class)

4. I looked through the contents and found the password: 17qSVuyT

5. Solved!
